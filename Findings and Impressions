🎉 Olympic Data Analysis: Unveiling the Champions! 🏅
I recently dove into a dataset on Olympic athletes and medal winners, and the insights were nice! Here's a snapshot of what I discovered:
🏋️‍♂️ Around 11.000 athletes competed in the Olympics.
🏅 982 athletes achieved the honor of winning a medal.
🎯 Athletes between 25 and 30 years old secured the most medals.
🌟 Gender distribution among the winners: 48.54% Men, 45.26% Women, and 6.20% Others.
🌍 Top 3 countries dominating the medal count: USA, China, and the United Kingdom
 There's a strong correlation between being a first-world country and performing well in the Olympics, Economic Resources, Sports Programs, Access to Technology and Science, and Cultural Emphasis on Sports.
 While these factors do not guarantee success, they create an environment where athletes from first-world countries are more likely to excel and win medals at international competitions like the Olympics.
